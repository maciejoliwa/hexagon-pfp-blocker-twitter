# NFT Hexagon Profile Picture Remover

This chrome extension removes tweets of people with
hexagon profile pictures on twitter.com :)

## Installation:

For now, you have to install it in a quirky way:
1. Download this repo (**Code** > **Download ZIP**).
2. Unzip it anywhere.
3. Open chrome and go to <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a>.
4. Enable **Developer Mode**.
5. Drag the unzipped folder onto the site.
6. Go to twitter.
7. Enjoy (:

### Just a quick memo:
* I have no idea if it works on mobile in any way :(
* It is very barebones, I've decided to create it like 5 minutes after I saw this hexagon/NFT thing by twitter
* If you think I am doing a bad thing by creating such extension - I don't care :>
